## Visualization of vehicular collisions in Manhattan

 [LIVE](https://julian-jurai.github.io/vehicle-collisions-data-visualization/)

### Background

As of recently the city's OpenData portal began publishing data that was once difficult to analyze. Over the past 2 years there has been over 100,000 collisions in NYC alone.
This project involves utilizing data provided by the NYPD to give some insight on the frequency, location and causation of these collisions.


### Functionality & MVP  

With this app, users will be able to:

- [ ] Identify locations where accidents have occured and the frequency at which they occur
- [ ] Differentiate between causations
- [ ] Identify areas where casualties have occured in the past
- [ ] Visualize the frequency of the collisions


### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for logic,
- `D3.js` with `HTML5` for effects rendering,
- `Google Maps API` with `Google Visualization API` for effects rendering,
